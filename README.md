# Overview

Simple Task Manager app for android written in Kotlin using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose. Users can add tasks and mark them as completed via a check/uncheck button. 

My purpose in creating this app was to learn about native Android development and understand the basics before moving into more complicated mobile development projects.
